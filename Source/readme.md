This is the source code. 

Currently it contains the following Jupyter notebooks:

1) Qi-Wu-Zhang model.ipynb: this notebook calculates the hamiltonian of the QWZ model, plots its dispersion relation, Berry curvature, image of the FBZ in pseudospin-space, and calculates its chern number to produce a topological phase diagram.
2) Haldane model symbolic.ipynb: this notebook uses sympy to calculate the hamiltonian of the Haldane model, plots its dispersion relation, Berry connection, Berry curvature, calculates its chern number and can produce a topological phase diagram.
3) Haldane model.ipynb:this notebook uses numpy to calculate the hamiltonian of the Haldane model, plots its dispersion relation, uses numerical methods devised in arXiv:cond-mat/0503172 to compute the Berry connection, Berry curvature, and Chern number, and can produce a topological phase diagram.
4) Edge state.ipynb: this notebook calculates the dispersion relation of the Haldane model on a finite, zig-zag graphene nanoribbon and displays the emergent edge states.
